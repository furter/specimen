“RAILWAY SANS is a previously unpublished work, originally digitised by my late friend and partner, the typographer Justin Howes, in 1994, some seventy-eight years after the first appearance of Edward Johnston’s ‘Railway’ type of 1916. Using an old SPARC station (remember those?) and some quick-and-dirty bitmap-to-vector software which I’d written and which output to ASCII Type 3 font format, Howes made an excellent digitisation of this unique and historical Sans. A Crosfield drum scanner was initially employed to capture the outlines which were then converted from bitmaps into vector font data.
<br><br>
Justin had wanted to capture and make an experimental font of this version, drawn directly from Johnston’s original artwork of 1913–1915 as part of the book he was writing on Johnston and other Johnston-related research, and later revisions and variations which were originally the only characters in the typeface in various samples and working proofs, kindly lent by Andrew Johnston. These included the famous arrows and alternate forms, which are contained in this version.
<br><br>
Seven years after Justin’s tragically premature death (and 96 years since Edward Johnston's revolutionary sans, “Railway”, was first revealed to the world), I’ve decided to release an open source version of the “fount”. I’ve done very little to Justin’s original work except to minimally adjust the kerning and add a few pictorial glyphs, along with composite accented forms. I’ve been using the very excellent FontForge and I’ve included the .sfd spline database file from which the font has been edited and compiled. Railway is licensed under the terms of the SIL Open Font License (OFT).”
